We have recieved an editorial on the actions of Nosey Nosin. We do not condone nor disvow this person's opinion on the matter, and are simply displaying it as a netural third party observer. Please read below:

‎

*"I am forced to admit Nosey's behavior is not exemplary of Bub Armies. Nosey's nonsensical attack on those who mocked Dannen points to a dictatorship of the Empire, led, unfortunately, by none other than Dannen: is what the Anti-Force members want us to believe. I believe, however, that we must first examine the credibility of this information.*

‎

*The Anti-Force is well known for their trickery. The possibility this is simply a ploy to draw attention away from the fact Ines Biller has decieved many before, gaining his position through treacherous actions, could shed some light on this political issue. Dannen has always treated us fairly and kindly, but we appear to have forgotten this, embroiled in the latest wave of politics. Our last emperor, Bax, treated us unfairly and only thought for himself. Were it not for the appearance of Dannen, we would all surely have been wounded and died, not physically but internally. Dannen saved us from this horrible fate of Bax's reign. Before mindlessly taking in information, we must always examine the source."*
