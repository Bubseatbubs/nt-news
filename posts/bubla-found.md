One day after Bubla's disappearance, she was found back home safely at the Empire. When questioned, Bubla simply stated, "Sorry! I got lost while playing a game of hide and bub."

‎

Nosey Nosin, brother of Bubla and general of the Empire, is very, very confused. "A simple game of hide and bub wouldn't have you disappearing for an entire day. She definitely would've gotten hungry at some point and ran back home. Still, I'm glad that she's back home safe and sound."

‎

With Bubla back home, some members of the Empire wonder whether more resources will be put into finding the truth behind the Insel der Katze, but Nosin doubled down on his previous statements: "Again, we are always stretched thin at the Empire. Feel free to discover the truth yourselves, but using resources such as the Empire's troops is out of the question."

‎

Finally, when asked if further security measures would be put in place, Nosin explained that "we're working on stuff that'll make sure that no bub runs off like that again."
