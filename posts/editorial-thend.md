We have recieved an editorial on the argument on whether Thend is justified. Once more, we are fully against Thend's actions, as they are both immoral and illegal. In that regard, we do not agree with the editorial, either, but are presenting it nevertheless:

‎

*"Hur hur hur! You are trying to slander my friend now, are you? Well, not on the Pro's watch!*

‎

*Thend only has the best people's needs in mind! He doesn't steal just 'cause he wants to. I mean, he did when he was a kid once, but we were all kinda brats then, yeah? Here, let me tell you what happened. I was just a wee [little] boy, dreaming of being a big boy, eating a nice piece of Lanfell chocolate, when Thend swoops in outta nowhere and eats it right before my eyes! Right! Before. My! Eyes. Doesn't that just make your blood boil, or just me?! I wish I could travel back in time to beat up kid Thend to defend myself! Right before my eyes... hur hur hoo... Oh, right, I was supposed to write about Thend himself. In the present... He's a good guy! He only has the best people's needs in mind! He doesn't steal just 'cause he wants to. Wait, did I already [write] that part? Hey, you guys interviewed Aeodine, right? Can you ask her what she meant about 'The worst part was most definitely the Professional, though'? Please, I thought I made a good first impression! Er, wait, I'm not the Professional, I'm the Pro, his good friend. Just like I'm Thend's good friend. And Thend only steals from criminals, that's why he's cool! ...Does queen Aeodine hate me?"*
