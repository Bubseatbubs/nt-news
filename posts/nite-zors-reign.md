Nite'Zor is a leader with a troubled past. Though he has governed quite fairly for the last several months, some citizens at Korazon, Dawnfade, have explained that this was not always the case.

‎

"There was a point in time where Nite'Zor would capture people for simply overstepping a little bit. Even something as minor as littering could land you in prison. A guy like that was something to be reckoned with," a Lost Spirit named Forvaire explained. "I can't lie - that experience soured my opinion of him considerably."

‎

Aleir, a Lost Spirit that was passing through Korazan during Nite'Zor's tyranny, believes that Nite'Zor should be forgiven - just this once, at least. "I was there at his worst, and it was *pretty* bad," she told reporters. "But now, you could say that his head's been cleared. He knows what he's doing now."

‎

Knighters, a piece captured by Nite'Zor during this era, has forgiven him despite of his tyrannical past. "Yeah, he's made a lotta mistakes, but so have I. If he's making steps to fix what he broke and apologize to those he's hurt, then I'm willing to forgive (though not forget)."

‎

Even Nite'Zor himself has chipped in, stating how his crimes were "unforgivable": "Please do not turn the other way because my crimes are in the past. They've hurt people in the present. What I've done is unforgivable, and what I do now is penance."

‎

Although many in Korazan are willing to give Nite'Zor a second chance, not all are. "Friends and family alike were held up by that monster," Pawnloom of the Pawn House explained. "I don't believe his lies. Neither should you."

‎

With Nite'Zor effectively given a second chance, many apprehensively wait to see if he will hold up to his word. Please stay tuned for any updates regarding the governor of Korazan.
