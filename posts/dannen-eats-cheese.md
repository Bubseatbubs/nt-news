This afternoon, Dannen was reportedly given his first bite of cheese since he was born. Dannen was witnessed telling flabbergasted spectators that it was "firm, but fresh" and had a "positively golden taste".
‎

The one who cooked the cheese, Chee "Z" Zamub, told reporters that he was in tears at Dannen's affirmative comments. "I wanted the emperor's first bite to be one full of the best parts of cheese. Maybe he'll eat more now that he's had the best to try..."

‎

Nosey Nosin, Dannen's second in command, had this to say about the event: "You guys are seriously reporting about this? I swear, after the election, you haven't written one good article. Go bother someone else, like Ines Biller."

‎

It is unknown what other foods that Dannen has not tried yet, though it is rumored that he has not tasted the sweet, succulent Seetbeet Borscht. We at NT News will continue to give reports on whether he will eat this meal.
