A massive turn of events has somehow made it so that Darren emerges victorious once more. If you haven’t been paying attention to the Empire, these events may shock you! 

‎

After Jard stepped down in June of 719, Dannen’s path seemed to be coming to an end, too. Even the candidate Noze was more popular than him. How did it come to this? After all, Dannen, has always been hailed as one of the greatest emperors of the Empire. Well, it seemed that Ines Biller’s smear campaign worked successfully. In this smear campaign, Biller pulled up history of Dannen’s relationship with Ortheus. Of course, many know of Ortheus as the ruler who mysteriously disappeared many years ago, and who re-emerged with a much darker personality. Biller claims that Ortheus now serves the true evil of the world - the abyss below us. This claim was laughed off, but still, people began to recall when Ortheus disappeared. It was in one of the worst times, too.

‎

Historian Lubo Wined recalls the situation as if it happened yesterday. “The Empire was dying with the Anti-Force being created, as well as Bax’s destruction of the economy. Dannen had promised to work to rebuild the economy from the ground up. This was a faint glimmer of hope in these dark days, but it didn’t last long. A week after stating this, Dannen’s co-emperor, Ortheus left.”

‎

“It was terrible, just terrible,” Wined continues. “What could’ve taken Dannen and Ortheus perhaps only a few months to accomplish turned into almost two years of work for Dannen. Even worse, Dannen tried to defend Ortheus’s actions, but it didn’t work well at all.“ 

‎

Since people shared similar sentiment to Wined, it didn’t take long for people to start associating Dannen with the traitor Ortheus. Biller’s statements made this much, much worse - and before long, some called Dannen a traitor to the Empire. On July 12th, 719, Dannen tried to give a speech to refute these claims, but it seemed that no one would believe him. What could he say, after all? 

‎

For months, it looked as if Biller was going to win this campaign, which made most bubs happy. During this time, Anti-Force grew in numbers, leaving the Empire with only dozens left. On July 30th of 719, Biller decided that it was time to show his true colors. He announced that if he were to win, then he would destroy the Empire and start anew with the Anti-Force, as well as renaming the Anti-Force to the second Empire. This decision shocked many, but people still thought it would be a great idea. After all, who would want to associate with a crumbling Empire?

‎

On August 2th, 719, it is believed that a team of investigators was founded. These investigators called themselves the Deepsearch, and their goal was to dig up data on Biller. It is unknown whether Deepsearch is connected to the Empire or Dannen, or if they are merely independent. A week later on August 8th, Deepsearch revealed shocking evidence about Biller.

‎

It seemed that Biller contained letters from Ortheus himself! Even worse, they seemed to be having a long conversation, as many letters were found. The Anti-Force had always refuted claims that they were connected to Ortheus in any way, so this reveal struck a large blow into the Anti-Force. To add on to this, evidence revealed that Biller manipulated Jard into stepping down from the campaign. Jard supporters who were voting for Biller retracted their support immediately. It seemed that overnight, Biller had lost all of his support. Even worse, some began to question his true motivations. Was Biller evil? It seemed that he was. Soon, most bubs who were loyal to the Empire but not to the Anti-Force retracted their vote from Biller, leaving him in the dust. However, Biller decided to go in the opposite direction. Instead of denying the claims, he admitted that he had ties to Ortheus, but stated that Ortheus wasn’t evil. Additionally, he would break all ties with Ortheus just in case he was. Those who agreed with him decided to stay with Biller, and researchers estimate that the Anti-Force grew by at least three times from this election.

‎

The remaining few now were to decide whether to vote for Dannen, or Noze. Noze had risen drastically after Biller’s downfall, and it seemed that he was going to win. However, on September 3rd, at least a month after Deepsearch’s attack on Biller, Dannen finally made his final speech of his campaign. He stated that he had experience fighting - something that Noze lacked. With this experience, he would be able to take down Anti-Force. While some skirmishes had happened between the two groups, a war between two forces had never occurred before.

‎

On September 5th, Noze withdrew from the campaign and stated that those who were still loyal to the Empire should vote for Dannen. His reasoning was the Dannen would likely be the one to lead them to war either way, and him being emperor would make that much easier. And so, on September 13th, 719, Dannen has been declared emperor of the Empire.

‎

Additionally, the war between the Anti-Force and the Empire has officially begun. N.T News is loyal to the Empire, so while reporters cannot interview those such as Biller, expect to hear news from Dannen himself.
