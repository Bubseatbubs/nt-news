It has been awhile since the haunted island of Ollingri has risen from the abyssal depths, but this morning, it was sighted by some pilots flying over the world.

‎

"It's been a *fat* minute since I've seen that hunkerin' island," Bibb "The Rover" Bobb explains. "Last time it was out and about, I hadn't been divorced yet!" (Bibb Bobb threatened to retract his statement were we not to include this part.)

‎

"I swear I saw Binsy Buon down there, chillin' with the dead," another pilot reports. Buon was unfortunately caught up in a terrible accident several years ago, with his body never found. "Feels like just yesterday that Buon was playin' cards with me."

‎

As the Empire's leader is currently leading an expedition of his own, an attendant of the Empire was asked for their opinion instead. Bobe, a surveyor of the lands, had this to say: "Ollingri's a natural phenomonon, so I wouldn't pay it any heed, really. Still, it's cool that it's paid us another visit!"

We at NT News should warn you to *not* step foot within this island. The ghostly bubs that populate the surface are known to be quite hostile to trespassers. Only the most well-experienced bubs should consider paying this island a visit (though once again, we do not endorse this act!)
