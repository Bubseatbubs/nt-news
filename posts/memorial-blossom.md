Tomorrow, a grand memorial will be held for the anniversary of Blossom Lord's passing. Blossom Lord, the youngest of the four lords of Bangeress City, tragically passed away several years ago. Since then, the people of Bangeress have never had proper time to grieve - until now.

‎

"It has been awhile since I've done something like this," admits Red Lord, who has recently allowed for outsiders such as us at NT News to step foot within his city. "After Blossom Lord's death, I think I internalized the pain I had... now, I'm ready to memorialize her for the whole city to see." Red Lord has stated that every person that attends will recieve a flower that symbolizes her spirit.

‎

The memorial itself is planned to be set up at Blue Lord's Bubsketball Court. "I think she'd like it!" exclaims Blue Lord, who has excitedly prepared large quantities of flowers for the showing. "She's just gone for a bit, right? So she'll show up here!" (Please note that Blue Lord is currently under the impression that Blossom Lord is merely missing.)

‎

Attempts to ask Gradient Lord on her own thoughts were denied by her guard, Rookup, though he was pleased to answer for her. "Her Handness is well aware of the memorial and has plans to show up there herself. Please do not disturb her for the time being, unless need be."

Although most COOL Creatures appear to be sound with the memorial, some voiced their discontent against such an event. "It seems strange to host such a grand thing before doing anything meaningful for the people," one COOL Scout claims. "I'm happy to oblige, regardless, but I hope that they change the ways of the city soon." Others ponder whether other important figures will be recieving similar events for their passings. Overall, however, it appears that the city is glad to reunite over this event.
