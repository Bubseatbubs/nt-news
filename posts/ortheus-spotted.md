This morning, we at NT News have received multiple reports of sightings of **Ortheus**. These reports range from seeing him trekking throughout Ooboe and "cackling manicially" in Pinpi Forest. Both Anti-Force scouts and Empire troops alike were sent throughout Garaline to confirm whether these rumors were true, but both groups came up empty-handed.

‎

The initial witness of Ortheus, an Anti-Force member named **Bubbie Bore**, recounts his own encounter with Ortheus: "I was just bubbin' about like usual (that's a word, by the way (it's not? I'll make it one!!)) and came across Ortheus staring almost longingly on a nearby cliffside. It was a strange sight for sure, and I wasn't sure if I drank too much at Natali last night or if it was really the man himself..." At this point, Bore continued rambling to himself about the best drink at Bub Bar, never quite describing how Ortheus himself appeared.

‎

Ortheus has been one of the most elusive figures of the century. Many years ago, Dannen and Ortheus had both ran for emperor together, and had won the election by a landslide. Ortheus was praised for his sharp-witted intelligence that was only rivaled by Dannen’s. However, on October 17th, 2014, Ortheus had mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind no traces of where he had gone. Because of his abandonment of the Empire, Ortheus has been labelled a traitor to the Empire. Even Dannen himself had publicly denounced Ortheus, claiming his former friend to be the "most dishonorable emperor," though sources claim that Dannen privately did not believe this to be the case. 

‎

Throughout the years, many bubs have reported sights of Ortheus in areas such as Dakragial and Anti-Woods, but none have ever been able to capture him, nor describe his features. Similar sightings of a hooded, non-bublike figure have been reported (most recently by Noze four months ago), but it cannot be confirmed whether this hooded figure coincides with Ortheus.
