This week, the 2019 Empire campaign begins full force as candidates begin to express that they are running for emperor. Around five candidates have expressed themselves as running for this election.

‎

On the morning of March 10th, Dannen, the current ruler of the Empire, was the first to announce his presence in the election. This was quite expected due to how successful Dannen’s ruling had been. 

‎

Shortly after Dannen announced he was running for emperor again, another military leader emerged. This bub’s name was Jard - also known as Jard the Juggernaut. Jard was once one of the generals of the Bub Army, and through his command, the Nose Bub’s saw massive success in their wars against the Anti-Force and the Chexes. However, Jard soon retired after decades of leading the Bubs. Now he plans to lead them, but in a more royal light.

‎

On the next day, inspiring activist Nozѐ revealed that he was campaigning for emperor. He announced this in one of his many speeches: “Bubs, we once stood as a united community, tied together on this island. We once fought together, ate together, ruled the island together. Bax took that all away - but I will bring it back. I will unite the communities once more!” 

‎

Ines Biller then announced that he was running for emperor only hours later. This came as a shock for many, as Biller is part of the Anti-Force. He, too, plans to unite the two communities, and plans to mix the two political views together. 

‎

We conducted a poll to see who was ahead. Far ahead out of anyone else was Nozѐ, who was up at 53%. This is far more ahead than any other candidate. However, campaigning has just begun - stay tuned for more information on this election.
