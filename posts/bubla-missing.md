Bubla Nosin, a member of the Empire, has mysteriously disappeared yesterday night. Police reports show signs of an intruder who may have kidnapped her away, though no evidence can bring up who this intruder could be. 

‎

Nosey Nosin, brother of Bubla and general of the Empire, worries that time is running short. “Bubla is usually very cautious. She doesn’t trust strangers and all that. I’m thinking this might’ve been more of a kidnapping than anything... and a forceful one at that.”

‎

Nosin is currently the lead investigator in this disappearance, and promises that his feelings won’t get in the way of the investigation. He aims to scout multiple locations at the same time, and hopes to find some kind of evidence to prove who the real threat is.

‎

Others spoke up about the disappearance as well. Emperor Dannen himself appeared at the front of the Empire to declare the disappearance of Bubla. “My heart goes out to Nosey Nosin, who is a good friend of mine, during this time of great turmoil. If you happen to have any kind of leads on this investigation, do not be afraid to approach Mr. Nosin about it.”

‎

We at N.T News do hope that Nosin’s sister will be found in due time. Any updates will be quickly and swiftly reported.
