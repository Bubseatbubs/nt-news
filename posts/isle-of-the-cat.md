Insel der Katze is a place that many know to avoid. This tiny, dark mass of land is located south of Dakragial, though tales of it are far larger than the island itself. Some brave bubs attempt to discover the truth behind this foggy island, but few are able to live to tell the tale. However, for those who escape, many tell of the same thing: a solitary creature, shaped like a sausage with spindly limbs and deep, red eyes. This sausage, formed of eldritch energy, shrieks and screeches with a sound that no creature of Carnegiss is capable of making. Simply staring at it will lock you into its mind prison, with the only way out by jumping off the island -- and most likely, certain doom.

Most recently, a new victim was found, with his cause of death attributed to this island. Binsy Buon, a well-known pilot, was flying his blimp across the world, as he usually does every day. However, it appears that his flight was cut short. His blimp's wreckage was found on the cliffs of Insel der Katze, and his body was found on Dakragial. It is unknown what caused his death, but many are convinced that it was caused by the creature that lurks on the island. Buon's family has demanded for the Empire to look into this and kill the creature rumored to exist on the island, but the Empire has refused such requests.

“Our hands are already full,” Nosin states, [referring to the disappearance of his sister](bubla-missing "Nose Bub, Bubla, Gone Missing"). “It’s more likely that Buon died from crashing his ship, which is truly awful, but something that occurs more often than not. Please do not distract the emperor with campfire tales.”

Is the Insel der Katze’s dark secret true? Or is it simply a creepy myth? As always, the essence of a tale such as this is always uncertain.
