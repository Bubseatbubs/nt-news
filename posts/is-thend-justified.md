Before digging into this controversial topic, please note that we at NT News do not condone stealing in any way, shape, or form. This opinion piece is merely to present Thend's side of the argument, as well as to showcase why said reasons may not be justifiable.

‎

Thend, the leader of a rebellious gang of Snotty Berserkers, live on an undisclosed island located somewhere in Kor Radia. Thend is said to send his minions throughout the realm, stealing from... those who steal?! Indeed, Thend only targets those who he believes are thieves and wretches. Fortunately, Thend accepted our terms for an interview on his undisclosed island, though as shown, we cannot state where this island is located.

‎

**Thend:** Oi, before ya start askin' and yappin', I don't appreciate my guys bein' called "minions". They're my buds.

‎

**Busso:** Apologies. Is the rest of [the summary] correct?

‎

**Thend:** Obviously, or I'd be the yapper myself. Anyhoo, what's this thing all about? Why do ya got cameras set up all over my base? Thought this was all on the down low.

‎

**Busso:** Apologies again. Those are not cameras; they are COOLcorders © that are used to record our conversation so that I can transcribe it later. May we begin with the interview now?

‎

**Thend:** Sure.

‎

**Busso:** Do you believe that your acts of stealing from those who steal is justified?

‎

**Thend:** What kinda question is that? If I thought it wasn't, I wouldn't be doin' it, ya hear me?

‎

**Busso:** That is true. What if your information about someone is incorrect, and you target someone who did not actually steal?

‎

**Thend:** My buds (and ya better call them that) are the best in the business. Ain't anyone smellin' the wrong scent, if ya get what I mean. We know a thief when we see one.

‎

**Busso:** Hmm. I see. What if the person you target is destitute, which is why they resorted to stealing from others in the first place?

‎

**Thend:** Ain't my problem; that's the queen's fault for lettin' it happen in the first place. 'sides, we split the money we steal with anyone in need, so why not just hit us up instead?

‎

**Busso:** What would need to happen for you to quit stealing?

‎

**Thend:** If my buds are out, I'm out. If they're here, I'm here. Simple as that. Well, y'know, if there was a wholly balanced economy, then maybe we could start talkin'...

‎

**Busso:** Finally, is there anything you'd like the readers back at home to know?

‎

**Thend:** You're gonna slander me for sure, so take my word for it. Sometimes it takes a big-ass thief to eat the smaller ones.

‎

**Busso:** There you go. Please remember that we at NT News do not condone any of Thend's actions whatsoever, and that what he does is illegal. Thank you for your time, Thend.

‎

**Thend:** Uh huh.
