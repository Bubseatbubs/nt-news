Today, a rather unexpected announcement was made. Jard the Juggernaut, a well-known war general, has stepped down from his campaign. This announcement was made in the morning at the entrance of the Empire. Jard was reportedly “tugging at his suit of armor and staggering his words”, which is quite unlike his normal demeanor. Jard was sure to let the people know that "my retirement from this campaign doesn't mean I will not stop fighting for the Empire." Finally, Jard capped off his speech by telling his supporters that there should be "No-se votes for Nozѐ” as he would weaken the Empire with his unmilitarlistic personality.

‎

Voters of Jard were both disappointed and shocked at this announcement. **Winy Babby** told NT reporters how “I-I know he wasn’t in first, b-but why would he drop out now?” **Serios Babby** shared a similar sentiment: "To drop such a bombshell on your ardent supporters is nothing short of crass. I will not be supporting Jard in any upcoming elections, lest he pulls a similar stunt."

‎

Many voters are now unsure where to split their votes. "I won't be voting for Nozѐ, that's for sure, but that only leaves Dannen and Biller. I guess Biller it is?" **Sily Gile** stated. Another follower of Jard, stating their name as **The Jardian**, had only this to say: "No Jard, no vote."

‎

Jard has not made any follow up to his announcement this morning, and has denied all requests for questioning.
