Today, members of **Anti-Force** began a smear campaign against the current leader of the Empire, **Dannen**. Protesters were seen standing around the Empire holding up giant signs, all filled with attacks against Dannen. These signs attacked Dannen’s physical features, stating statements such as: “This is not the face of the Empire!”

Some Anti-Force members claim that Dannen is simply not fit to rule due to his crippled face. An anonymous protester reports: “Dannen is trying to push what Bax was trying to push - more taxes on citizens to support the military!” Many protesters claim that the Anti-Force’s popularity will rise if Dannen continues to rule the Empire.

‎

As of now, Dannen has not responded to the protest, but one of the **Empire’s** generals, **Nosey Nosin**, has. “You’ve got idiots - just idiots - standing around and arguing about something even they know isn’t true. It’s bad faith, all of it.” Witnesses claim Nosin was seen attacking the protestors by headbutting them. Some Anti-Force members mocked Nosin’s attack: “He was like a squishy pillow.”

‎

Dannen still plans to campaign for this year, and this protest does not seem to affect this decision at all.
