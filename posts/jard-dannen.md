As the campaign continues, many wonder about two very similar candidates - Jard and Dannen. Dannen is a powerful ruler and military leader who commands the Empire’s Bub Army - however, Jard, known primarily as "The Juggernaut", was also a powerful general who won many battles at one point. How do the two candidates compare?

‎

On one hand, many can agree that without Jard’s position as a general, many battles would have been lost. Author of *War of A Tower*, **Mufin Lacker**, has studied the art of Jard’s wars for many years. Lacker notes the pure strategical genius displayed by Jard’s formations and attacks in an interview: “Jard, man. He’s one hell of a fighter and commander. He’s an artist of war.” 

‎

Jard’s strategical mind can be shown in the Great Pinpi Skirmish, in which Anti-Force troops and Empire troops collided. Instead of facing them head on, Jard let the enemy seep deep into the Empire’s forest, in which he unleashed a brutal surprise attack. “And the enemy, they couldn’t do much. Man, they just cowered, hoping that the general would spare them mercy,” Lacker states. “And you know what? He did. He spared all of them, because he’s just like that.” 

‎

On the other hand, Jard has not done much as a political leader. When asked about Jard running for emperor, Lacker admits, “Jard’s a commander, but not a ruler. Maybe it can happen, but I don’t see it working out myself.”

‎

Dannen, on the other hand, has shown his worth as a ruler of the Empire. While his military intelligence may not be as great as Jard’s, Dannen has shown that he can command an empire. As the two duke it out in the 719 campaign, we can only wonder who will be the preferred emperor.
