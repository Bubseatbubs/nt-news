We at NT News have heard you loud and clear: after the events of Dannen's journey, many have been clamoring for a greater scope in our reports. The Lands of Night, as it is deemed by residents of that realm, has welcomed us with welcome arms (for the most part). Likewise, the spirits of Kor Radia are thrilled to support us on reporting stories from across worlds. As such, we will be opening offices in both the city of Lanfell and Bangeress, and hope to cover a great deal of information from both worlds.
