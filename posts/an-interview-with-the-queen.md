Aeodine is a newly promoted queen of spirits who has a large responsibility to fulfill. Naturally, we at NT News have many questions for the new queen. Please enjoy this interview we conducted.

‎

**Ethos:** Welcome to our offices, queen Aeodine.

‎

**Aeodine:** The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Ethos. It is always a treat to see a bub like yourself in the great city of Lanfell.

‎

**Ethos:** When Relia passed the mantle of responsibility to you, what was your initial reaction? Delight or horror?

‎

**Aeodine:** It was sudden to be sure, yet I found myself *wanting* this. Relia is the greatest spirit I've ever known, bless her soul, so do not take this as though I believe I could do a better job than she did. However... I've always wanted to be useful, and this was a great way to step up into the limelight. So, to answer your question, it was a mixture of surprise and acceptance.

‎

**Ethos:** Have there been any struggles in your time as queen?

‎

**Aeodine:** It would be more prudent to ask if there *hasn't* been a time where I was not struggling. Becoming the authority in all things spirit-related is a monumental task. My time as the queen's advisor has fortunately saved me much time on the knowledge front, but I am missing much of the experience. I can only hope that citizens of Lanfell are willing to stumble with me on my journey. Of course, the time where I had to confront [REDACTED] with Relia was perhaps the greatest struggle of all.

‎

**Ethos:** [REDACTED]? Who are you referring to?

‎

**Aeodine:** [This section of the interview has been cut out.] The worst part was most definitely the Professional, though. [This section of the interview has been cut out.] And that bub with a shield traded blow after blow! [This section of the interview has been cut out.] We were almost turned into stardust.

‎

**Ethos:** How interesting. Now, to get back on topic, were an average bub to stumble into Lanfell, where should they be heading first and foremost?

‎

**Aeodine:** Be sure to pay a visit to the markets of Lanfell -- much of what they sell cannot be found anywhere else. Don't forget to book a room in the Lanfell Inn, that place fills up quite quickly. The clothing here is phenomenal: you cannot find anything like it anywhere else. There's a lake not far from the castle itself where citizens rest and collect their thoughts... it's quite a soothing area. Speaking of the markets, I would recommend trying the chocolate here; it's quite different from what you'd normally expect. Of course, the castle is always open to all visitors. We host a grand deal of fine artifacts crafted by the finest craftspirits. Ah, I can't forget that if you're in the mood to train, please meet up [the following section has been cut out due to the interviewee rambling for ten minutes straight]. As you can see, there's a lot to see here!

‎

**Ethos:**  ...I-I see, that's quite a lot to do. Thank you for your time, queen Aeodine. It has been an honor.

‎

**Aeodine:** It has been a pleasure, thank you.
