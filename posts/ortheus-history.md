Today is not the greatest day for current leader and candidate Dannen, who has recently been attacked by an investigation done by the AFI (Anti-Force Investigators). The AFI has reported new information on how Dannen obtained his spot as emperor. 

‎

The report states that: “Dannen might have taken advantage of underhanded tactics from Ortheus. For example, Ortheus may have hired some men to change the voting numbers. It is within the capability of this traitor, after all.” 

‎

This report also states that Ortheus may have drugged or attacked other potential candidates as well.

‎

Although Ortheus had ruled only four years before, many had forgotten that he had ruled with Dannen once, which developed much controversy online. However, instead of attacking his rival, Dannen instead defends him: “Ortheus wouldn’t do any of that. I knew what he is like in the years before he became evil, and he wasn’t like that.”

‎

Dannen’s defense of Ortheus has stirred the masses. A few Anti-Force members have seemed to do a 180° on their opinion of Ortheus, now coupling him with Dannen, stating them both as corrupt criminals. This group is only a very vocal minority of the Anti-Force’s majority, though. Many Anti-Force members defend Dannen instead. For example, well-known activist Siminal Peebo states that: “Although I do not agree with Dannen’s ideals, have you all forgotten that Ortheus & Dannen’s ruling was one of the best rulings we’ve ever had? Or have you guys all forgotten that Ortheus ruled the Empire once?”

‎

Other candidates have not expressed their opinion on their reports, including Ines Biller, who is well known for trying to attack Dannen. Peebo talks about this as well: “This report doesn’t really have much to do with Dannen, so I see why no one important is talking about it. You all are getting angry about things people already know.”

‎

Unfortunately for Dannen, the vocal minority has caused many Nose Bubs to change their opinion on their former emperor. A poll conducted today now shows Dannen in third place:
