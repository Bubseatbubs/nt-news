Mateil has been an important resource to the Empire for many years. In fact, some may argue that the Empire would not be as great as it is if it wasn’t for the existence of mateil. If you do not know, Mateil is a type of mineral that can be transformed into liquid if put at boiling point. This liquid can be used to power many types of vehicles, including blimps, hot air balloons, and other kinds of vehicles that are usually used when travelling across the Empire continent.

‎

However, in recent years, the company leading the Mateil industries mysteriously stopped their work. This company is one that usually mines for ores, so while it is strange that they stopped gaining Mateil, it isn’t the only thing that they do. Other companies have tried to take over their mine, but to no avail. This mine is now off limits to most people, though no reason for this is stated. Although this mine is very close to the Empire, Dannen has not dispatched any troops to the mine, so this shows that it is likely not a pressing matter for most places.

‎

Still, some economists have grown concerned of the top Mateil companies dropping out of the race. After all, this company has been leading for a while. One economist named Gioen Muney has stated that “This may show a drop in using mateil in general. Though that may appear to be bad, I think it’s just to open up the way for a new future to fuel. There are already some alternatives being built, such as using Vitrolium or Gool. I think this is why Miners Inc. have stopped mining Mateil, and to be honest, it makes sense. As I stated before, Vitrolium is being developed at a rapid pace. At least 36% of blimps use this material. So I think we’re in good hands.” Muney’s words appear to cull any doubts of a drop in Mateil mining. However, only time will tell on how effective the alternative to Mateil will be.
